```

> Missing delimiter leads to unexpected behaviour

One more issue with above example:

> Image links shouldn't have google.com inside them. This means that the image source is not copied properly from Google Image site.

```text
Did you sing with your band lastnight?
-Yes, I did [do][didn`t].
-No, I didn`t[don`t][did].
```

> There can be only one example per slide(not two)

Also:

> No spaces between true option and the lies
---

```text
Were[was][are] they in Plovdiv to the Metallica`s concert a couple of years ago?
```

> `was` and `are` should be capitalized

Also:

> Backtick \` is different from single quote ' and the latter is usually prefered in cases such as "Metallica\`s"

---

```
-Yes, they were[was][are].
```

> If questions are the last part of sentence, then there should be an empty space between the last square bracket and the punctuation.

---

```
Yes, they were[was][are] so [much.more][many.more][many] other options.
```

> As this is a complex example(it contains more than one word), all questions should be within square brackets(including the simple questions).

So the following is correct:

```
Yes, they [were][was][are] so [much.more][many.more][many] other options.
```
