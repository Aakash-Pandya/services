  difference
    ✓ finds the set of all elements in the first list not contained in the second
    1) does not allow duplicates in the output even if the input lists had duplicates
    2) has R.equals semantics
    ✓ works for arrays of different lengths
    3) will not create a "sparse" array
    ✓ returns an empty array if there are no different elements
