  reduce
    ✓ folds simple functions over arrays with the supplied accumulator
    ✓ dispatches to objects that implement `reduce`
    ✓ returns the accumulator for an empty array
    1) Prefers the use of the iterator of an object over reduce (and handles short-circuits)
    2) short circuits with reduced
