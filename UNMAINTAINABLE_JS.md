# UNMAINTAINABLE_JS

Based on the sarcastic idea of [https://github.com/Droogans/unmaintainable-code](https://github.com/Droogans/unmaintainable-code) which is tightly coupled with `Java`. This document try to do the same within `Javascript` context.

## Mix cases when naming

```js
const FOO = 'foo'
const bar = 'foo'
const baz_even = 'foo'
```
